# Description

Pineapple Lang is a simple programming language demo. It includes a hand-written recursive descent parser and a simple interpreter, although the language is not even Turing-complete. But this repo's main goal is to give beginners of compilation principles a warm up and a simple look at how a programming language is built.


# How to run

```terminal
$cd examples
$go build
$ ./pineapple hello-world.pineapple
pen pineapple apple pen.

```
